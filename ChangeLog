	Update to glibc 2.22. Since the full change log can be fetced from the
	glibc source, only the most important changes and libgnurx-specific
	changes are recorded here.

	glibc internally, that are used in the changed files.

	* regex.c (comment): Update license header.
	* regex.h (comment): Likewise.
	(macros): Hide more struct members and macros behind __USE_GNU. The

	* aclocal.m4 (MINGW_AC_MSVC_IMPORT_LIBS): New macro; implement it.

	* configure.ac (MINGW_AC_MSVC_IMPORT_LIBS): Use it to define...
	(GNURX_LIB): ...this; no longer set explicitly.
	* configure: Regenerated.

	* Makefile.in (GNURX_LIB): Use AC_SUBST result, in place of...
	(gnurx.lib): ...this, as a prequisite for `all' target.
	(MSVCLIB): Define explicitly; do not use AC_SUBST result.

	(MINGW_AC_MSVC_IMPORT_LIBS): ...this aclocal.m4 macro.

2007-05-02  Keith Marshall  <keithmarshall@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix bugs reported by Julien Lecomte <julien@famille-lecomte.net>

	* Makefile.in (OBJECTS): Make them depend on `Makefile', to ensure
	that they will be recompiled after any rerun of `configure'.
	(DEVDIST_FILES): Don't duplicate `regex.h' in `lib'; it's already
	explicitly copied to `include'.

	(prefix, exec_prefix, bindir, libdir, includedir, mandir): AC_SUBSTed
	macros, specifying installation directories.
	(LDFLAGS): AC_SUBSTed linker flags.
	(MSVCLIB): New macro; AC_SUBSTed to invoke or avoid use of `lib'.
